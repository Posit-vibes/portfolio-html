<h3>Survive</h3>

<p>Frédéric Jardin’s “Survive” doesn’t necessarily break the mold. But being original isn’t totally important for this schlocky French disaster flick. 
See, disaster movies often follow a pretty standard formula; you only need to trade out the disaster, and the script for “Daylight” is about the 
same as “The Poseidon Adventure.” “Survive” simmers with the same tension as those films. It’s a sunny world that appears normal for a 
family of four sailing off the coast of Puerto Rico until strange signs catch their collective sight: tumultuous clouds, an abnormally rough sea, 
and a disrupted internet connection.</p>  

<p>The family is sailing to celebrate Ben (Lucas Ebel) turning 13. Ben’s father Tom (Andreas Pietschmann) teaches him to fish while his mother 
Julia (Émilie Dequenne), a doctor, floats in the tranquil water near the boat. She is saved by Tom from nearly drowning when a sudden whirlpool 
pulls her down. Ben’s sister Cassie video chats with her boyfriend when his video freezes. Then satellites whose fiery form mirror comets crash into 
the sea. A vicious storm kicks up, and it appears all is lost. When the family awakes the next morning having survived the squall, the water is gone. 
Their boat is sitting on the now craggy seafloor. Tom suspects the poles flipped, causing the seas to shift to submerge the land.</p>

<h3>Every Little Thing</h3>

<p>“Every Little Thing” is a kindhearted film for unkind times.</p> 

<p>The documentary about a Los Angeles woman who has made it her life’s mission to rehabilitate injured hummingbirds has a gentle sweetness that 
feels like a balm. Terry Masear, the subject of writer-director Sally Aitken’s film, has a no-nonsense demeanor, but her affection for these 
tiny creatures is unmistakable. She gives them names like Raisin, Cactus and Wasabi. She assigns them narratives as she observes their behavior. 
She painstakingly builds them elaborate aviaries and lovingly feeds them from a syringe. 
And she devotes every inch of her sprawling Hollywood Hills property, inside and out, to their care.</p> 

<h3>Pepe</h3>

<p>Guttural sounds permeate the landscape before an ominous voice takes over. Both belong to an enormous creature, a hippopotamus about to share the 
uprooting that landed his parents in Colombia and which resulted in his untimely death at the hands of men in 2009. In “Pepe,” a formally imaginative 
and thought-igniting experimental docufiction, Dominican director Nelson Carlo de Los Santos Arias molds the real-life events around the hippos 
imported by notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar into an exciting, visually unpredictable consideration of colonialism and human hubris tinged with 
the fantastic.</p>
